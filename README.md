# 🚲 Bike Sales Data Analysis

Welcome to the **Bike Sales Data Analysis** project! In this project, I worked with a dataset related to bike sales, where I analyzed key metrics such as sales performance, product categories, and regional sales trends using Microsoft Excel. I utilized tools like Pivot Tables, Pivot Charts, and Slicers to provide meaningful insights from the data.
